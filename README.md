A simple CLI based calculator program  
This program accepts parenthesis and basic calculations. The operation that still needs to be added is the exponent operator and its functionality. Other than that this program runs perfectly.  
The program has no external requirements other than tha installation of python 3. The program is self-contained so running it directly in your computer would allow you to evaluate expressions.  
The expressions must be in valid mathematical forms. It will raise an error when an operator is mismatched (checking for matched parenthesis still needs to be done).
